# User stories

- As a [user], I want to [know what is this game about] so I can [learn a new game and play with others].
- As a [user], I want to [start a new game] so I can [start play with the opponent].
- As a [user], I want to [choose a cell to put X or O] so I can [put X or O].

# My stratigies for solving the problem

*First, I have made the board that is contain the numbers from 1 to 9 which is 3 x 3 grid by using the grid property.*
*Second, I have decided that the first player will automaticlly had X and the second player had O*.
*Third, I have made it seems like this way -> When the game start, the player should choose a cell to play and then click the button to move to the second player and so on.*
*Finally, I made a function to check if there is a winner or would be a tied game.*
